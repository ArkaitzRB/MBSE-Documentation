Structure
	> 00:45 Introduction
		- Activity Diagram is usually the starting point to set the functionality of each part of the System
		
	> 02:53 Structural elements in SysML
		- 02:58 Block
			* Fundamental SysML Element of Structure
			* Represents:
				+ Systems
				+ Subsystems
				+ Components
				+ Hardware
				+ Software
				+ Abstract Items (Data, ...)
				+ Real Items
			* 04:20 Define by its features:
				+ Structural
					o Value Properties
					o Part Properties
					o Interfaces/Ports
					o Constrain Properties
					o Associations to other Blocks
				+ Behavioral
					o Operations
					o Activities/Activity Diagrams
					o State Charts
			* 05:12 Generalization
				+ Simplfies Block behavior
				+ Group similar behaviors in a common Class
				+ Generalizations "Classify"
					o Inherit Values and Operations
					o Extend or Specialize functionality
			* 06:16 Associations
				+ In order to communicate with other Blocks
				+ Could be:
					o Directed (One Way) - represented as an arrow
					o Two Way - represented as a line
				+ They take Name:
					o Directed has a Name
					o Two Way has 2 Names
				+ 7:26 Types of Associations:
					o Aggregation
						# Directed or Bidirectional
						# Represented by a Hollow Diamond (rombo vac√≠o)
					o Composition
						# Represent a Part of the Model
						# NOT shared with other Blocks
						# Represented by a Solid Diamond
		- 08:27 Part
			* Block decomposition component. Blocks which construct Blocks
			* It can be shown as:
				+ Directed composition 
					o Block constructed by Blocks
				+ Parts Property
					o List of Properties of the Block
					o It is an overal View
				+ Internal Block Diagram
					o Show internal Parts and their relationships (with Interfaces)
					
		- 08:27 Internal Block Diagram (IBD)
			* Shows Blocks' composition, associations, relations between their Parts and Internal Ports and Interfaces (to do that relations)
			* RECOMENDATION: 7-10 Blocks or less in each IBD
				+ Each Block could be composed by other Blocks (with its IBD)
			* 12:26 Activity Diagrams contains essential information:  
				+ Swimlanes represent Parts of the Block
				+ Actions (squares) represent an Operation of the Block
				+ Loopings and Time actions represent Behavior, which are better represented in a StateChart (next Module)
