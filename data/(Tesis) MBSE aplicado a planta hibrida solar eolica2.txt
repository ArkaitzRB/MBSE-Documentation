Generally speaking, the modelling of power systems is performed using software such as Matlab Simulink, DigSilent, PowerWorld etc. These software programs allow modelling of a system considering only a specific viewpoint, depending on the objective that is to be assessed.
The advantage of the SysML over the above mentioned modelling languages lies from the fact that SysML includes different viewpoints of a system. These views are known as the Four Pillars of SysML. Pillar One refers to the requirements of a system and includes all the functional and non-functional requirements. Pillar Two deals with the structure representation of a system by considering all its subsystems and their different connections. Pillar Three considers the behaviour of a system and includes its activities, sequences and different states. The last Pillar includes the detailed characteristics, physical laws and constraints on the system.
