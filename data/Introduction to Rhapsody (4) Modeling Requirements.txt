Requirements
	> 1:06 What is
		- ID
		- Descriptive Text
		- Links/traces
			* To other elements
		- Constrains
			* Range
			* Applicable options
		- Attributes
			* Tags - Ex: Type of Model they affect
		- History
		
	> 5:50 To check if is CORRECTLY defined: 5 Cs
		- Complete: all characteristics defined
		- Correct
		- Consistent: itself and with other Requirements
		- Confirmable: Testable
		- Necessary: a Requirement is something that has to be achieved, not a recommendation

		- 8:40 Requirement Diagram
			* Requirements are defined by:
				+ Frame (like a Box representation)
				+ Name
				+ Identification ID
				+ Description

		- 10:15 Types
			* Requirement types:
				+ Requirement
				+ Constrain
				+ Note: remainder, explanation, recommendation, ...
			* Dependiency (linker) types:
				+ trace (see 13:25): generic link
				+ derived From (see 12:55): addition of Requirements to one Requirement. It goes from the new Requirements to the Base
				+ satisfy (see 13:52): generally goes from an Artifact (not Requirement, such as Use Case, Block, ...) to a Requirement
				+ verify: goes from Test Cases to a Requirement
				+ refine: special case - give more info to the Requirement
				+ copy (not recommended)
				
		- Traceability Matrix (13:25):
			* Very useful to see Requirements' dependencies

		- 14:04 Traceability importance
		
		- 15:58 Others...
			* Use Cases: group Requirements together
			* Activity Diagram & State Chart Diagram: allow to specify flows' Requirements
			* Parametric Diagram
