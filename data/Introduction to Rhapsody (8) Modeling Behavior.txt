Behavior 
	> 00:46 Behavior
		- What does the "piece" do when it receives the Interaction message
		- Implemented via:
			* Operations
			* Flow Charts
			* Activities
			* State Charts
			
	> 01:45 State Charts
		- Very simple Behavior representation
		- Represents State/Event driven Behavior
			* State: period that wait something to happen (represented by squares)
			* Event: transition from/to States (represented by arrows)
		- Start at "Default Transition" (represented by a circle-point with an arrow)

	> 03:49 States
		- Known condition
		- System is in the State until a defined transition happens
		
	> 04:36 Events/Transitions
		- SysML defines 4 types:
			* Timeout event
				+ Time is reached Or an amount of time is elapsed
			* Signal event
				+ Asynchronous signal received
				+ (in Rhapsody) an event
			* Call event
				+ Operation call received
				+ (in Rhapsody) a triggered operation
			* Change event
				+ Change in Value ocurred
				
	> 08:01 Event Actions
		- Actions are executed WHEN entering/leaving a State
		- Actions are Run To COMPLETION behaviors
		- Actions are performed:
			* On Exit
			* On Transition
			* On Entry
			* Internal Transition In State (in nested States)
			* On Timeout
		- Guard (Trigger):
			* Boolean expression to determine if the transition occurs
			* ALWAYS is checked (even if the transition does not occur)
		NOTE: Order of Operations execution:
			* Guard Condition
			* Action on Exit
			* Action on Transition
			* Action on Entry
			
	> 10:08 Example 1: Two ways of representing Nested States
	> 13:00 Example 2: Transitions with History on the Timeout
	> 14:08 History Connectors
		- Returns State Chart to the most recent active State
		- 2 types:
			* Deep History Connector:
				+ Includes history of all sub States (States inside a State of the actual State Charts)
				+ Represented by the circle filled in blue
			* Shallow History Connector:
				+ Includes only current State level (this State Chart level)
				+ Represented by the circle filled in white
		- Only 1 History connector per State
		
	15:10 Parallel Regions in State Charts
		- Allow Multiple Substates within a State
		- All Regions receive the Same Event "Simultaneously"
		- Regions are aware of each other (can "Test" others "State")
