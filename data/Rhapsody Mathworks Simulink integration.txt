Rhapsody Mathworks Simulink integration
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db3XWYKJSdo

	> 00:14 There are 4 different options to integrate SIMULINK execution with Rhapsody modeling:
		<<img:Rhapsody & Simulink integration options.png>>
		
		- In this video will be explained the 2nd one: "Generate executable code from a Rhapsody model with parts implemented in Simulink"
	
	> 00:39 Import Simulink Model
		- They should be imported by a "SimulinkBlock" in Rhapsody
		- Input/Output Ports of the Simulink Block are exposed as the rest of Rhapsody flowports
		
		- In order to import the model:
			1) NOTE: Simulink Profile should be load previously
			2) Insert a new Block, and select its Stereotype as "SimulinkBlock in Simulink" 
			3) Select the Block, and with mouse's secondary button select "Import/Sync Simulink Model"
				* Select MATLAB executable
				* Select SIMULINK Model file
				* Select SIMULINK Generated Source Code (NOT always... - WARNING: Research when it is necessary to add this file)
					+ 02:40 NOTE: previously in SIMULINK, should get executable of the Model by "C/C++ Code / Code Generation Options"
			
	> 04:20 Create a Model from Rhapsody
		- Create the Block in Rhapsody ("Class" object)
		- Create its Ports
		- Add its Attributes (corresponding to the Ports)
		
	> 05:57 Create Runtime Object
		- Create the Block in Rhapsody ("Composite Class" object)
			* For further information, see "Creating runtime objects and init relations"
			  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkgLb_VS9fQ)
		- Insert every previous Blocks into this component
		- Link Blocks
		
	> 06:46 Configure Simulation on Rhapsody
		- Set "Runtime Object" as initial Instance
		- Choose Instrumentation Mode to "Animation"
		
	> 07:08 Add New Panel
		- From SimulinkModel Tree, select "Add New / Diagrams / Panel Diagram"
		- The Panel allow to watch ports' values during the Simulation on Rhapsody
		
	> 07:46 Run Simulation
		- Select "Code / Generate/Meke/Run" to compile the Simulation
