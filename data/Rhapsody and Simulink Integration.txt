	> 00:45 Model simulation:
		- Some Parts better suiter to SIMULINK
			* Continuous algorithms
		- Some Parts better suiter to RHAPSODY
			* Discrete algorithms
			* Event driven systems
			* Architecture
			* Requirements linkage
			* ...			
	
	> 01:10 RHAPSODY <-> SIMULINK Integration Points
		<<img:Rhapsody & Simulink Integration Points.png>>
		
	> 01:56 Architectural and Behavioral Modeling & Simulation
		- 3 Options:
			* Import SIMULINK Models into RHAPSODY 
				+ REQUIRED: SIMULINK "Real Time Workshop")
			* Export Models to SIMULINK
				+ SysML Block automatically converted into S-Functions in SIMULINK
			* Full Plant Modeling (INTERESTING)
				+ RHAPSODY may create entire SIMULINK Models from a combination of RHAPSODY Blocks, and SIMULINK Models
				+ There is NO SIMULINK "Real Time Workshop" Requirement
				+ SIMULINK performs the EXECUTION
				+ RHAPSODY animation could be run at the same time -> Real Co-Simulation between RHAPSODY and SIMULINK
	
	> 03:51 Guide of "Full Plant Modeling"
		- First: SIMULINK "Profile" should be added
		- In order to create SIMULINK model, Blocks of type "Simulink Model" should be created
			* SIMULINK model could be imported to them (*.mdl files)
			* Imported model could be opened from RHAPSODY in SIMULINK
		- 06:40 In order to export the "Full Plant Modeling":
			* Create a new Internal Block Diagram
			* Insert desired "Simulink Model"-s in the Diagram
			* Insert desired Connections between Models
			* Export Model: "context menu (secondary mouse button) / Simulink / Export"
		- 07:53 Exported Model could be executed in SIMULINK
			* From Rhapsody, editing "Simulink Model" blocks, SIMULINK execution settings could be changed
				+ It will be updated in the following Exported Model to SIMULINK
				
	> 08:48 Mixing Rhapsody and Simulink Models
		- Instead of importing all SIMULINK Models, it could be a mix of RHAPSODY and SIMULINK Models
		- 09:12 Creation of a new Rhapsody Model Block (instead of "Simulink Model")
		- 09:26 Adding Ports to the Rhapsody Model Block (and link it to an Attribute to propagate the value)
		- 10:42 Add Behavior to the Rhapsody Model Block (for example, by a State Machine - StateChart Diagram)
		- 11:45 In order to export the Entire Model (Mix Models of Rhapsody and Simulink):
			* Export Model: "context menu (secondary mouse button) / Simulink / Export for Animation"
				+ Export for Animation: Enables to show the simulation in SIMULINK and in RHAPSODY
				+ To show StateChart animation (and Debugging), select "Tools / Animated StateChart"
	
	> 13:40 Example
		- Complex example with multiple "Simulink Model" Blocks and Rhapsody Model Blocks
		- 13:56 Rhapsody Panel Diagram is added to analyse the execution
			* NOTE: Research if it is INTERESTING
