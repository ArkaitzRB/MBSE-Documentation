Use Cases
	> 0:40 Requirement
	
	> 2:55 Use Case Diagram
		- A Use Case is really like a Requirement of the System
		- Composed by:
			* Use Case: Feature, Function of the System
			* Frame: System Boundary. Group elements of the system. 
			* Actor: people, systems, components that interacts with the System (and are outside the System)
		- Shows WHAT the System is going to do
		
	> 4:46 Use Case
		- IS a Requirement: specify WHAT the System is going to do to meet the other Requirements
		- Satisfies one or more Requirements
			* Shows the implementation of these Requirements
		- Refined in (added detail):
			* State Charts
			* Activity Diagrams
			* Sequence Diagrams
		
	> 6:31 Why use Use Cases
		- Show Capabilities
		- Show Scope
		- Help Understand better the System functionality
		- Help Validate the System
		
	> 8:50 Define Usage of the System
	
	> 12:03 Actors
		- Represents elements outside the System
		- Won't be modeled
		- Represent People, others Systems, Components
			* NOTE: Represent ROLES
				+ if a Person/System plays 2 Roles, 2 Actors should be represented
		- Traditionally shown as a Stick, most tools let change it by a Picture
		- 14:33 - Identifying actors
		- 15:25 - Naming
		
	> 16:00 Relations
		- Actor to Use Case
			* Communication or Action
			* No direction
		- Actor to Actor
			* Generalization or Inheritance
		- Use Case to Use Case
			* Generalization or Inheritance
				- <<extends>> Additional behavior
				- <<includes>> Common functionality
		...  ...
