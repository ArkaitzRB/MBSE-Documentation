		- 12:00 - Start SysML Project Tutorial
			* New Project:
				+ Project type: SysML
			* If not selected SysML, SysML profile should be added 
				+ later could be selected:
					o "File/Add Profile to Model..." and select "SysML/SysMLProfile_rpy/SysML.sbs"
				+ To completely make SysML project:
					o In the Project root select "Change to/SysML"
			* Add HarmonySE profile
				+ Enable Systems Engineering Toolkit
				+ "File/Add Profile to Model..." and select "HarmonySE/HarmonySE.sbs"
			* Create Harmony Project
				+ Create a set of Folders and Diagrams - Useful to organize projects (standarized)
				+ Select Project root and "SE-Toolkit/Create Harmony Project"
			* Add artifact from another Model
				+ Allow us to load Packages (ex: Models, Requirements, ... of  a Library)
				+ "File/Add to Model"
					o "As unit": the element is imported (enable editing)
					o "As Reference": not importing, read-only element, constantly linked to the original file
